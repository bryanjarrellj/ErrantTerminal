[PLEASE NOT: THIS PROJECT DOES USE GIT LFS FOR LARGE FILES]
A small Unity desktop game prototype.

Created as a one week prototype, this project was meant to implement
custom 2D character movement and more thought on project architecture.

After showing the prototype to multiple friends, I gained a lot of feedback 
on what works and what should be improved.

- Players seemed to like the movement options of the character.
- The also liked the UI to show when their abilities were recharged.
- Clicking two points was not intuitive, it should be click and drag instead.
- There was little game feedback on if a rectangle is too large to destroy an enemy.
- Some players used brute force to defeat puzzle levels.
- Some players were frustrated by the twitch action levels.
- Players appreciated the simple graphics, as well as the twist on the later levels.

Known issues:
- The tracking enemies sometimes disappear, making a level unable to be completed.
